# mvi_base
Base classes for MVI architecture


This model is inspired by Redux and Flux model. Some core actors stay the same as in Redux but some of their behaviors may change adapting the requirements of Android environnement. The idea, as Flux's creation's purpose, revolves around a **strict unidirectional data flow**.

The main actors in the model are:

- **View**: this is always the start point of flow. It dispatches an _Action_ to _Store_. When _Store_ sends back output, _View_ updates UI within `render()` method. This method is also the end point of the flow. So a complete and close flow is starting from a _dispatch()_ and finishing with `render()`. In this part, there are 2 smaller elements, _View_ and _ViewModel_. Different from MVVM model, _ViewModel_ here is no more than a state manager (thank to the principe of _ViewModel_ from _Jetpack_) for _View_. It does not contain any logic business. 
    - Codes in _ViewModel_ are less (even not) _Android_ than in _View_, it just helps to hold and to mutate the state.

    - Typically, _View_ performs every actions related to UI. On top of that, it helps to bind data from _ViewModel_ to UI

    - Relation between _View_ - _ViewModel_ is : `n..1`

- **Action** : defines what will happen. Different from Redux, Action carries and transfers current state of view

- **Store** : not like _Store_ in redux, this _Store_ does not hold states of application but it acts like:

    - a singleton

    - *Reducer* carrier
    
    - Point communication between _View_ components (fragments, activity)

- **Reducer** : in redux, _Reducer_ forms an object with an unique function `reduce()`. However, in this model, object `Reducer` no longer exists but its magic method `reduce()` is integrated directly in _Store_.This method is a pure function that takes _Action_ as input and return _State_. This is where all core logics happen, so to keep it maintenable and testable, there are things that should never happen in `reduce()` function:

    - Mutate the arguments
    
    - Perform side effect actions.

- **State**: updated state container which will be sent to _View_ to `render()`

# Structure of base classes

To keep an certain abstraction level, some base classes are created to perform the relation between components in the architecture.

- **BaseView** (BaseFragment, BaseActivity):  Each _View_ is defined with 3 dependencies: type of Action, type of State and type Store. As a typical element in _View_ part, _BaseView_ provides _dispatch()_ and `render()` method. It contains a _Store_ reference and probably a _ViewModel_ one (or shareViewModel) corresponding (if state management is required). This _ViewModel_ reference can be bound to xml layout to take benefit of _DataBinding_.

- **BaseViewModel**: this is a Lifecyle observer because its lifecycle depends on the lifecyle of its _View_ it is attached to. Since this component is also in _View_ part, so _BaseViewModel_ provides also _dispatch()_ and `render()` and hold a reference of _Store_. On top of that, it may (or _should_ because purpose of its existence is to manage states of View) contain states.

- **render()**: this method should never be called this outside of a flow. State will not be changed without an action dispatched

- **BaseStore**: except some core elements like `reduce()` method mentionned above, _BaseStore_ contains a *Dispatcher* which does some pre-setup (things like providing executor for action) for every action dispatched. Moreover, _BaseStore_ provides methods to *subscribe* and *unsubscribe* state changes. _BaseStore_ is a singleton at module level (I'm not sure wheather _"module"_ describes exactly what I mean but like a process that can work isolately from other. For instance, in my projects, authentification (login/enregister/password foggotten etc..) is a process, main flow is another one, payment is too etc.., and each module contain only one Activity so the Store depends on the lifecycle of that container Activity).

- **reduce()**: knowing that I'm currently using RxJava for my threading and reactivit√© handling, so `reduce()` is a chain of Rx operators starting from an _Observable<Action>_ and returning an _Observable<State>_
  
- **Dispatcher**: filter the action received from _View_ and prepare environnement for the execution.

# Flow (what you have to really do after having all base classes ready)

![Image of diagram flow](resources/diagram_flow.png)

To start a flow:

- Describe what you want to do by defining an Action class with required data.

- From either _BaseView_ or _BaseViewModel_, `dispatch()` that action.

- Handle action in `reduce()` method of _Store_ while defining an _State_ returned.

- Update UI in `render()` _View_ or update state in  `render()` of _ViewModel_.

- And then, you are good.

# Analyse
####  Avantage
- This model takes benefits of **unidirectionnal flow**:
    - Easier to debug because at any point of a flow, you know where it comes from
    - System of Action/State helps you have more control over your data
    
- Core logics of application are situated in Store within `reduce()` method, and the fact that this is a _pure-function_ makes it obviously easy to test.

- Communication between components is done with helps of Publish/Subscribe pattern and abstraction layer, it makes the system loosely coupled and avoids mixing Android framework codes with Java codes

#### Disadvantage

- Many class generated (Action/State) when you want to execute a flow. It's getting hard to manage _Action_ and _State_ classes when system becomes more and more large
